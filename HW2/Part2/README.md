### Strategy

The three strategies put in terms of parallell computing would essentially amount to
1. Opportunistically allowing guests (threads) to see the vase. This has the advantage of working really well if a lot of guests aren't trying to see the vase at once, but will not perform well if they are as they're will be a big group of guests (threads) doing nothing well they keep retrying the door. There is also potential for deadlock since its possible everytime someone tries the door they can't get in because someone else got in before them.
2. This would be implementing a "lock" of sorts in the form of the sign on the door that says "AVAILABLE" or "BUSY". This is advantageous as the threads can still go back and do other things but they don't know when to return to the door and likely will have to retry many times before it is available. There is also still potential of dealock if everytime someone returns the room is "BUSY"
3. The final method of implementing a queue of threads with an implementation of a CLHLock. This is the ideal implementation and the one we go with since it is deadlockfree.
