### Strategy
The strategy that was followed to tackle this problem was to implement a lock free linked list that all of the presents would be added to. Each servant was turned into a thread. Since the sequence of operations each servant took for the presents was unconsequential, it was chunked to 5000 add / contains operations that are chosen randomly followed by 5000 remove operations on the list. This helped with memory of the list and significantly helped increase runtime since storing 500000 presents in memory would have been near impossible with the memory limitations of my computer.
